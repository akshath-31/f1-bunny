Master Prompt for f1-bunny UI Redesign (ChatGPT Style)

Current State:
- F1 Bunny landing page has:
  - A Formula 1 logo in the top left, adjusted for sizing and visibility
  - Welcome message and chat input below
  - Question boxes previously removed
  - AI chat interface that responds with markdown-formatted text (bold/italic/lists), recently improved for basic readability
  - Music feature with mute/unmute icon above feedback button, music auto-plays on site load
- The chat UI now renders markdown, displays bold text properly, and uses larger text with improved line spacing—but still retains original styling elements and layout from F1 Bunny.

Upgrade Requirements (Make UI Like ChatGPT Web, Step-by-Step):

1. General Layout:
   - Use a dark/neutral background with subtle gradients for the main chat area.
   - Add rounded message bubbles for both user and AI (left/right alignment)—no boxy rectangles.
   - Center chat container on page with generous padding (top/bottom/left/right).

2. Header:
   - Place the F1 Bunny logo and project name in a simple horizontal row at the very top (left corner).
   - Add a small button for "Settings" or "Feedback" on the far right of the header bar.

3. Welcome Message:
   - Hide the "Hey there!" welcome message after the first prompt is sent (just like ChatGPT).
   - If shown, use larger, readable text with extra line spacing.

4. Chat Area:
   - Improve message bubble design:
     - Use soft rounded corners
     - Alternate slight background color for user vs assistant messages
     - Shadows or light borders to make bubbles pop out
   - Use proper markdown-rendered text:
     - At least `prose-base` or `prose-lg`, larger line height
     - Paragraphs, lists, and headings should all be well-spaced and readable

5. Scroll and Experience:
   - Auto-scroll chat container to bottom on new messages.
   - Keep input bar sticky at the bottom (like ChatGPT).
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Support [Enter] to send, [Shift+Enter] for new line.

6. Chat Input Section:
   - Use a wide, rounded input bar with a clear placeholder ("Ask Vax Merstappen anything about F1…") 
   - Add a visible "Send" button styled as a circle—animated hover (matches UI in ChatGPT).

7. Music Icon & Feedback:
   - Place the mute/unmute icon above feedback (bottom right), keeping them small and non-intrusive.
   - Icon should be soft-rounded background, match new color scheme.

8. Typography & Colors:
   - Use a modern sans-serif font throughout, avoid monospace.
   - Base text in off-white or light gray, assistant bubble in slightly brighter shade.
   - Use accent color (like F1 red) for highlights/buttons.

9. Responsiveness:
   - Make sure all elements scale for mobile (no horizontal scrolling, inputs never go off-screen).

Instructions to Lovable AI:
- Analyze the uploaded screenshots for reference. Current UI is "f1-bunny"; target UI is ChatGPT web.
- Apply all upgrade steps above for a professional, easy-to-read, chat-first experience. Use best practices for accessibility, contrast, and responsiveness. Match ChatGPT's overall style in layout, text, bubbles, and input bar. Keep F1 Bunny branding and music feature intact and non-intrusive. Implement only these changes unless further guidance is provided.
